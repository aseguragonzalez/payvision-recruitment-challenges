# Hi there! Welcome to Payvision Recruitment Challenges 

First of all, thank to be interested in Payvision. If you are here, could be for only two reasons. **First**, you are in the middle of the hiring process and you have to resolve the challenge. **Second**, you love coding. In both cases, we want to hear more about you.

## Ground Rules

We prefer well-thought-out solutions over the quick-and-dirty kind. So take your time, if you need it. A rushed job is usually matched by a swift rejection. Average completion time so far has been around one week. Submission is done via e-mail sending it to [jobs.spain@payvision.com](mailto:jobs.spain@payvision.com)
